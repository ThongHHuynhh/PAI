# Changelog

One section per release, newest first. An `-rc` tag ships the section of the release it is a candidate for.

## v0.1.0

- First release of PAI: a self-hosted server that runs agents on every machine you connect, on any model.
- Memory across sessions, models and machines. It has hybrid recall (BM25 + embeddings), a learnt recall policy (LinUCB), a usefulness filter that refuses secrets, consolidation that merges related items, and history for every change.
- Rolling compaction at 70% of the context. The full history stays in the session file.
- Accounts: several accounts per subscription, moving a session to another account or vendor, and automatic failover when an account hits its limit.
- Web app: live graph, chat, memory, settings. White and dark themes, for desktop, tablet and phone.
- Terminal app with the Orbit home screen, and a CLI.
